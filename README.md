# Nashville-Housing
This repository contains the code and data files for a project focused on analyzing Nashville housing data using SQL. The data cleaning phase has been completed, ensuring that the dataset is accurate and ready for further analysis."
These are the steps that have been taken:
1. Import our dataset into PostgreSQL
2. Check the null values and coalesce them with related values
3. Break down some columns to indivitual ones to be more useful 
4. Update missing values in columns to avoid multiple in-vain values
5. Remove unused columns
